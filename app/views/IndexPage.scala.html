        <p>All the data you see here is pulled and rendered automatically from various sources including Github and UMP.
            If you notice something is not quite right you can usually fix it by updating those directly, and when we next refresh
            the data you will see it change here.

            If you have any queries, feel free to reach out to <a href="https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/messages/team-platops/" target="_blank">#team-platops<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"/></a>
